For example, if you had all of your tmLanguage files for Rails organized in a folder like this: <code>Packages/Rails/Language/*.tmLanguage</code>, and you were looking to use the <code>Ruby Haml.tmLanguage</code> file, the path to name translation would simply be: <code>Packages/Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage</code> \u2192 <code>Rails/Language/Ruby Haml</code>.</p> <pre><code>\"syntax\": \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml\"\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that the paths are relative to the <code>Packages</code> folder.
